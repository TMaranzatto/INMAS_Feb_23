Airplane boarding simulation

## Basic Setup:

We use a matrix to represent the seat and when passangers board the airplane, it will change the matrix entries from 0 to 1. We also want to visulize our simulation of boarding strategy.

## How to use the code:

Run `testing.py` to see our testing process.
Run `create_graphs.py` to generate the visulization of default boarding strategy: random boarding.
